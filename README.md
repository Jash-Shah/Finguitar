# Finguitar
This is our repo for CodeOdyssey HackaThon 
Its called Finguitar.(Finger-Guitar)
It uses Computer Vision to build an online instrument which you can play using *just your fingers*.
You can hold up a gesture with your hand and the web-app will record it using your webcam and play a music note for every gesture!
The idea is to then give the user the ability to combine these gestures to make a tune out of it.
So, it's like playing a guitar...but using Computer Vision!
